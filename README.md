# Invariant Superpixel Features for Object Detection & Localization
*by Sam Johnson*

## Introducing DSeg

DSeg is a novel superpixel-based feature designed to be useful in semantic
segmentation, object detection, and pose-estimation/localization tasks. DSeg
extracts the shape and color of object-positive and object-negative
superpixels, and encodes this information in a compact feature vector.

While this project is only in its infancy, DSeg has already shown promising
results on superpixel-wise object detection (is superpixel A part of an instance
of object class B?). Below we cover the implementation details of DSeg, present
preliminary experimental results, and discuss future work and additional
enhancements.

## Motivation

Many who work or dabble in computer vision have noticed the intrinsic, deep coupling
between image *segmentation* and higher-level tasks, such as detection, classification,
localization, or more generally, whole-image *understanding*. The interdependence
between these crucial computer vision tasks and segmentation is undeniable, and often
frustrating. A chicken-and-egg scenario quickly arises:

> How can you properly find the outline of an object without knowing what it is?

> On the other hand, how can you begin to understand the context and identity of
an object, before determining its extents?

### Superpixel Segmentation

One "neat trick" that partially alleviates this issue is the superpixel segmentation
algorithm. Superpixels arise from a clever, *over*-segmentation of the original image.
Once the superpixel algorithm has been run, virtually all major and most minor edges
and boundaries in the image will fall on some boundary or another between two
superpixels. This fact exposes an intriguing trade-off: after running the superpixel
algorithm, we can rest assured that virtually all edges and boundaries of interest
have been found *somewhere* encoded in our superpixels. That said, we unfortunately
*also* have to deal with a large number of minor or imagined edges that are
included in the superpixel segmentation.

### Properties of Superpixels

Superpixels are extremely powerful because they often fall on important boundaries
within the image, and tend to take on abnormal or unique shapes when they contain
salient object features. For example, in the superpixel segmentation of the below
aircraft carrier, notice that the most salient object features (the radar array,
anchor, and railing of the carrier) are almost perfectly segmented by highly
unique superpixels.

*Fig. 1: A superpixel segmented aircraft carrier. Salient features are revealed by the superpixels.*

From this example, several intuitions arise:
* In general, superpixels tend to hug salient features and edges in the image
* "Weird" superpixels that differ greatly from the standard hexagonal (or rectangular)
  shape are more likely to segment points of interest
* "Boring" superpixels are part of something larger than themselves, and can often
  be combined with adjacent superpixels

### Advantages of Synthetic Data

When writing object detectors, it helps to have images that fully describe the broad
range of possible poses of the object in question. With real-world images, this is
seldom possible, however the advent of readily available, high quality 3D models,
and the maturity of modern 3D rendering pipelines has created ample opportunity to
use synthetic renderings of 3D models to generate training data that:

* Covers the full range of poses of the object in question, with the ability to render
  arbitrary poses on the fly
* Can be tuned to vary scale, rotation, translation, lighting settings, and even occlusion
* Is *already segmented* (at every possible pose) without the need for human labeling
* Is easy to generate, no humans required once a 3D model is made

## DSeg Feature Extraction Pipeline

In this section we outline the details of the DSeg feature extraction pipeline and comment
on the major design decisions and possible future work and/or alterations.

### Image Data Sources

DSeg requires a synthetic data source (i.e. a 3D model of the object that is to be learned)
to generate *class-positive* training samples, and a "real-world" image source, preferably
scene images, to generate *class-negative* training samples. That is, we use synthetic data
to generate *positive* examples of our object class's superpixels, and we use real-world data
to generate *negative* examples of our object class's superpixels.

For this project, we used the high quality ships 3D model dataset from [1], and SUN2012 [2]
for real-world scene images. In particular, we randomly sampled 2000 images from [2],
and for each 3D model in [1], we rendered 27,000 auto-scaled, auto-cropped poses uniformly
distributed across the space off possible poses at 128 x 128, at a fixed camera distance,
and with slightly variable lighting. The rendering of these images is covered in greater
depth in [1].

### DSeg Step 1: Segmentation

SLIC [3] is the state-of-the-art method for performing superpixel segmentation, whereas
gSLICr [4] is a CUDA implementation of SLIC that can perform superpixel segmentation at
over 250 Hz. Ideally we would use gSLICr in our pipeline, however significant modifications
would need to be made to gSLICr to make it possible to extract the pixel boundaries of the
generated superpixels, so we settled on the slower, VLFeat [5] implementation of SLIC.

We run SLIC on each image in our training set with a constant regularization parameter of
4000 (so as to avoid over-sensitivity to illumination). We do this over a range of 25
different grid sizes to ensure we capture all of the possible superpixel shapes that
could occur within our object (or couldn't occur, in the case of negative examples). For
positive examples, it is necessary to ignore superpixels that are not part of the object,
however this is easy since we rendered translucent PNGs and merely need to ignore
superpixels with transparent pixels.

*Fig. 3: Superpixel segmentation is performed at multiple scales*

For each valid superpixel found in the current image, we will eventually create a
feature vector. Before passing these superpixel features on to the next pipeline
stage, we calculate the *closest-to-average* RGB color for each superpixel. That is,
we calculate for each superpixel the RGB color from its color palette that is closest
to the mean RGB color across the entire superpixel. We measure color distance simply using
the 3D euclidean distance formula. Future work might explore LAB or other color spaces.

In practice, stage 2 yields approximately 700 features per positive input image, depending
on the model and viewing angle.

### DSeg Step 2: Scale Invariance via ResizeContour

To obtain scale invariance for our features, we must normalize all of our superpixel
features to the same square grid size. For this project, we used a 16 x 16 pixel grid.

A naive approach to this normalization phase would be to use an off-the-shelf image
re-sizing routine, such as bicubic or bilinear interpolation. In practice, we found
that these algorithms, along with nearest neighbor and other alternatives all result
in either excessive blurring or pixelation when up-scaling very small features (which
are quite common in DSeg, as most features are approximately 6 x 6 pixels in size.
This blurring or pixelation means that a neural network will be able to tell that
the feature in question was up-scaled. The purpose of scale invariance is to hide
all evidence that any sort of up-scaling or down-scaling has taken place, so this
is undesirable.

### ResizeContour

ResizeContour is a simple, novel algorithm for up-scaling single color threshold images
with neither the pixelation introduced by nearest neighbor, nor the blurring introduced
by bilinear interpolation. ResizeContour is how we up-scale superpixels (especially very
small ones) in DSeg. The algorithm itself is relatively simple:

1. Project each pixel from the original image to its new location in the larger image
2. Find all the black (filled in) pixels among the 8 pixels immediately surrounding our
   pixel in the original image
3. Project the coordinates of these dark pixels to the new larger image
4. Perform a polygon fill operation using this list of projected points

*Fig. 5: ResizeContour in action. The + signs represent pixels from the original superpixel.*


Because we fill in overlapping polygons over each pixel in the image, this approach will
only work if the entire image is of one uniform color. A side effect of this algorithm
is that one pixel lines are usually erased from the resulting image, however this is good
as it makes our features more block-like and more resistant to artifacts in the
pre-segmented image.

Once the superpixel is re-sized to our decided canonical form, our feature vector is ready.
We store the thresholded values of the pixel grid, concatenated with three floats
representing the RGB value of the *closest-to-average* color. For a 16 x 16 standard
superpixel size, this results in a 16 * 16 + 3 = 259 dimensional vector.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the efficacy of DSeg as a general purpose feature, we constructed a simple
experiment that trains (using RPROP) a standard feed-forward Multi-Layer Perceptron to
take a single DSeg feature as input and output a single value indicating either that
the feature belongs to an instance of our object, or that it is background noise and/or
part of an unknown object. We conducted this same experiment on each of the 7 models used
in RAPTOR ([here](https://github.com/samkelly/raptor/tree/master/data/models)) and observed
slight variations in performance.

### Network Topology

For our neural network, we used OpenCV's Multi-Layer Perceptron implementation. We used
the recommended settings for Resilient Backpropagation (RPROP), which is known to converge
more quickly than standard backpropagation, and has much fewer free parameters that need
to be configured.

![basic MLP setup](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/_images/mlp.png)

#### Input Layer

For input data, we used the formulation discussed earlier, generating features from our
27,000 positive input examples, and generating features from 2,000 negative input examples
randomly selected from SUN2012. When a feature is sent to our neural network, it is
processed as a 259-dimensional vector of floats, where the input grid is represented as
0.0's and 1.0's, and the RGB color is represented as three floats. Because of the inordinate
number of features generated by this procedure, we randomly selected 500,000 features from
the input set, and trained off of these. We used a 50/50 negative/positive example split.
We also utilized a separate validation set roughly 1/2 the size of our training set.

#### Hidden Layer

We found that a hidden layer consisting of 48 neurons was sufficient. While we experimented
with networks with many more neurons (and hidden layers), none seemed to have any advantage
over our 48 hidden neuron setup. For an activation function throughout the network, we used
the classic hyperbolic tangent function.

#### Output Layer

We used a single output neuron, where a value less than 0.5 indicates the input was not of
our object class, and a value of 0.5 or greater indicates the input was of our object class.

### Results

The table below displays the accuracy results for the best network we were able to train for
each of the 7 RAPTOR models, including the model name, number of training epochs, and accuracy
(based off of the validation set).

Model | Training Epochs | Accuracy
--- | --- | ---
Hamina | 140 | 72.24%
Halifax | 189 | 69.98%
Kirov | 137 | 71.31%
Kuznet | 162 | 70.12%
SovDDG | 145 | 65.7%
Udaloy | 80 | 70.17%
M4A1 | 153 | 71.5%

Most models were able to yield 70% accuracy or nearly 70% accuracy. It is no surprise that the
Hamina missile boat performed the best, as of all the models it has the highest number of visually
recognizable features, and is not as oblong as the other models. The M4A1 is the only model in the
set that is not a ship (it is, in fact, an assault rifle). It was our second best performing model,
most likely due to its easily recognizable shape and correspondingly unique superpixel shapes.

Given that we used a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron, it is striking that we were able to achieve
even 70% accuracy for a task as difficult as per-superpixel object classification.

## Future Work

Follow-up studies must be conducted to continue to verify the efficacy of DSeg as a multi-purpose
feature vector. In particular, it will be important to benchmark DSeg as a feature in deep
networks that perform object detection and/or localization.

A very valuable study that could be conducted would be to generate DSeg features for objects in
MS COCO, and supplement this data with synthetic data rendered from 3D models of common objects
in COCO. This would allow us to benchmark DSeg against a commonly used dataset.

Performing classification based on a single superpixel feature is extremely difficult. Perhaps
an easier (but more difficult to design) experiment would be to create a network that takes
as input a DSeg superpixel feature, augmented by features for the top 5 nearest superpixels.
The network would be trained to determine the object classification of the middle superpixel,
and this would be significantly easier because it would have context information in the form
of the surrounding superpixels.

## Installation

DSeg has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04. To install, do the following:

1. Make sure you have CUDA installed and available (visit [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads]   
   (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for more info.
2. Clone the DSeg repo `git clone git@github.com:samkelly/DSeg.git`
3. `cd` into the local repo
4. `./install_prerequisites.sh`

You can now run the "delvr" command-line utility via `./build_run.sh`. You can customize
build_run.sh to carry out various DSeg related tasks (see commented out lines for examples).

## Related Work

Of particular importance to this project are the original SLIC superpixel segmentation
routine [3], gSLICr [4], the state-of-the-art CUDA implementation of SLIC, as well as
VLFeat [5], OpenCV [6], and the Boost C++ library [7].

The authors of [6] derive a *fully convolutional* model capable of semantic segmentation.
As with DSeg, their network performs superpixel-wise classification, resulting in fully
segmented object proposals. Unlike DSeg, their network can analyze an entire image rather
than one superpixel at a time, but as a result, their approach is more of an end-to-end
detection and segmentation solution than a feature extraction pipeline that might be of
some help to high level computer vision tasks.

In [8], the authors leverage a similar synthetic data scheme whereby commodity 3D models
are used to augment and/or replace real-world images in lieu of sufficient training data.
This idea first appeared in the 2014 RAPTOR technical report [1], from which this project
originally evolved.
